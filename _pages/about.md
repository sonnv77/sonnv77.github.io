Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, the University of Texas at Austin, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor Qiang Liu and Professor Nhat Ho. Before going to Austin, I was a Research Resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/) and was a Research Assistant at [Data Science Lab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/). I graduated from the honors program at Hanoi University of Science and Technology with a Computer Science Bachelorâ€™s degree.

My CV is available [here](https://sonpeter.github.io/CV_SonNguyen.pdf).

## Research interests
My research intersects probabilistic modeling, deep learning, and optimization, aiming to integrate the complementary advantages of these areas into foundation problems of modeling, inference, and learning.

Currently, my work focuses on developing efficient and theoretically sound optimization algorithms for large-scale deep learning with non-conventional constraints.

I am also particularly excited about scalable and robust probabilistic methods applied in complex settings of several domains such as Bayesian deep learning, deep generative models, hierarchical Bayesian models, and online/continual learning.
