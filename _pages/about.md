I am currently a second-year Research Resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/) where I am fortunate to be mentored by Ass. Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). Before joining VinAI, I was a Research Assistant at [Data Science Lab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/) under the supervision of Professor [Khoat Than](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?hl=en&user=z2_6ZRYAAAAJ). I graduated from the honors program at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/) with a Computer Science Bachelorâ€™s degree.

My CV is available [here](https://sonpeter.github.io/SonNguyen_CV.pdf).

## Research interests
My central research has been motivated by developing impactful and interpretable algorithms for machine learning models, with a current focus on methods at the intersection of probabilistic modeling and deep learning. I am particularly excited about efficient and scalable probabilistic inference methods applied in complex settings with computational bottleneck such as Bayesian deep learning, hierarchical Bayesian models, large-scale online/continual learning. I am also interested in principled deep learning techniques including optimization, generalization, representation, generative modeling, and so on.

Beside research, I am also interested in computer science algorithms and mathematics (especially Number Theory). When I was a high school and undergraduate student, I participated in several competitions in mathematics. I was fortunate enough to get good results in those contests.
