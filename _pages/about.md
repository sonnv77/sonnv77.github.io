I am currently a second-year Research Resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/) where I am fortunate to be mentored by Ass. Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). Before joining VinAI, I was a Research Assistant at [Data Science Lab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/) under the supervision of Professor [Khoat Than](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?hl=en&user=z2_6ZRYAAAAJ). I graduated from the honor program at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/) with a Computer Science Bachelorâ€™s degree.

My CV is available [here](https://sonpeter.github.io/SonNguyen_CV.pdf).

## Research interests
My core research focuses on developing interpretable and scalable algorithms for machine learning models. I am particularly excited about practical and flexible approximate inference methods applied in complex settings such as probabilistic deep learning, hierarchical latent models, large-scale online learning. I am also interested in principled deep learning techniques including optimization, generalization, representation, generative modeling, and so on.
