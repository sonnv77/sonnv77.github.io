I temporarily put the representation in the following [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/163EHfQXkjLQliOSEZIPWZUdkfbnuyVbK9J_5BleuNYk/edit?usp=sharing)
This informal presentation involves various works of Yarin Gal (OATML, Oxford), Andrew G. Wilson (NYU), Balaji Lakshminarayanan (Google), Dustin Tran (Google). Some slides are leveraged from the talks/tutorial shared by these authors.
